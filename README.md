## Description

PyOS is a lightweight framework built in **Python 3**, bundling useful GUI services and utilities into a unified toolset. It’s meant to be simple, modular, and easy to extend.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Multiple services/tools (e.g. file utilities, mini-apps, helpers) all in one package  
- GUI interface (using `tkinter` or similar) to simplify interaction  
- Modular architecture: you can pick, disable, or extend individual components  
- Easy control and configuration for end users  

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Clone / Fork the repo

```
bash
git clone https://github.com/xtreme-mc/pyOS.git
cd pyOS
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Then:

```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run it

You can start the main GUI or scripts:

```
bash
python main.py
```

### 4. Extend / Tweak

- Add new services or utilities in new modules  
- Hook them into the GUI  
- Improve performance, UX, error handling  
- Make custom builds or distributions

## 📂 Structure

```
pyOS/
├── main.py
├── templates/
├── assets/        
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── SECURITY.md
├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
└── ...
```

- `main.py` is the entry point  
- Each utility/service ideally lives in its own file or module  
- GUI scaffolding and resource files are kept separate

## 🧾 Notes / Tips

- Use version control (git) aggressively — keep small commits when you refactor  
- Test on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) if your GUI is cross-platform  
- Consider packaging (pyinstaller, or a proper installer) if you distribute it  
- Add logging, error handling, and config files (e.g. `.ini`, `.yaml`)

## ✏️ About

PyOS brings together small utilities under one roof. It’s not a full OS, but a convenience toolbox built in Python: use it, extend it, make it yours.
